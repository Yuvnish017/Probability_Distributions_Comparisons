# Probability_Distributions_Comparisons

This project was done as a part of B.Tech 3rd Year Course on Probability and Random Processes where I was tried to verify the following approximations and plot the Probability 
Distribution Functions/ Probability Mass Functions of different Probability Distributions for comparisons.
1. Binomial Distribution tending to Normal Distribution
2. Binomial Distribution tending to Poisson Distribution
3. Poisson Distribution tending to Normal Distribution
4. Hypergeometric Distribution tending to Binomial Distribution

This project was done using MATLAB 2020a.
